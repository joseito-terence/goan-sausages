	<p>It all starts from rearing of pigs. People into the buisness of sausage making rear pigs.<br>
	There are other people who are not in the buisness of sausage making ,<br>but they also rear pigs.<br>
	And then sell the pigs to the sausage makers.</p>
	

	<p>These pigs need to be fed well daily to make them fat,<br> so that they are big enough to get more meat.<br>
	Usually,in Goa they are given to eat the left over from our food plates.<br>Some others prepare special rice <b><i>Kanji</i></b>(called "pez" in konkani) for their pigs.<br> These pigs are sold for an acceptable price. </p>
	
	<p>Some people who rear pigs at home either make a small room for the pigs<i>(known as "Gud" in konkani")</i> and<br> leave it there, <br>while others leave the pig free so when the food is served for the pig ,
	<br>it comes has its food and goes.<br>
	The pigs in the small room or which are tied up are easy to catch ,<br>but the others are difficult to catch,<br> you have to run around  maybe for hours to catch the pig.</p>
	
	<p>These pigs are then baught by the sausage makers (known as <i>"choris kars/kans"</i> in konkani).<br> First the pig is stabbed in the neck so that it dies.<br>
	Ealier the skin of the pig was burnt with a piece of paper and scraped of with a knive.After this is done, with a razor blade the hair from the body was shaved off.
	<br>And now they connect a pipe to the gas cylinder, light fire to the pipe and burn the skin.By this they neither have to scrape the skin with a knive nor do they have to shave the hair. 
	<br>And then the pig is put on a table and cleaned, the pig is then separated into the skin, the meat and the bones.The skin is cut into small pieces
for Skin Sausages(in konkani known as "<i>Kati Choris</i>" where Kati means skin).The meat part is cut into smaller pieces than the skin for meat sausages (in konkani known as <i>Masa Choris</i>).
The bones are either sold in the market or to the bars.
Salt is applied to the meat and then put in a basket and kept for 1 hour. After 1 hour the meat is again put on the table. And then Clove Powder(<i>kalaphur pito</i>), Cardimon Powder(<i>thiki pito</i>),Turmeric Powder(<i>oldi pito</i>),Geera Powdre(<i> geera pito</i>), Ginger garlic paste(<i>alle losoon paste</i>) and chillies(which are soked over night) and these are then ground in the grinder mixer.
The masala obtained from the grinder mixer is then put mixed with <b>Vinegar</b>, which is then applied to the meat.After applying the masala, the meat is left 
for another hour. This meat is stuffed in to the interstines of the cow ,which are ordered from Hyderabad.First the interstines are soked in water to become soft.And then stuffed into the interstines.
Ealier the meat was stuffed by hand and now they have machines.After the meat is stuffed, it is tied with a string.
And finally they are steamed on the husk of the coconut and then sold in the market. These sausages can be then kept for years.</p>
