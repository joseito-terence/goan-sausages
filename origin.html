	<u><b><h2>Origin of The Goan Sausages</b></h2></u>
	<p><font size="4">This recipe was ealier used by the Portuguese sailors , to preserve the meat.</p><p> As it took days to reach their port from Goa and back again. And most of the food would get spoilt ,<br> so they used this method to preserve the meat(poke meat) on their long journey.</p>
	<p>This then was later adopted by the Goans to preserve the meat during the monsoon seasons,as the fishermens would not go to the sea,<br>and so they would not get fish.</p><p>And also there were no refrigators to store the food during their time.</p>
